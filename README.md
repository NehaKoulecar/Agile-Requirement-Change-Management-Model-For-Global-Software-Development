# Agile Requirement Change Management Model For Global Software Development

We propose a comprehensive and robust agile requirements change management (ARCM)
model that addresses the limitations of existing models and is tailored for agile software
development in the global software development paradigm. To achieve this goal, we con-
ducted an exhaustive literature review and an empirical study with RCM industry experts.
Our study evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed RCM model in a real-world setting
and identifies any limitations or areas for improvement. The results of our study provide
valuable insights into how the proposed RCM model can be applied in agile global software
development environments to improve software development practices and optimize project
success rates.
